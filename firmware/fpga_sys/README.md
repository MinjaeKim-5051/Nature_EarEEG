This repository contains the FPGA HDL source code used for signal data acquisition and on-device processing in the proposed system.

The code is provided for transparency and documentation of the system. It is not intended to function as a standalone or fully executable package. Reproducing the system requires specific hardware and vendor software (e.g., Microchip Libero SoC, FlashPro) as well as the corresponding project environment. Pin assignments and timing constraints are managed within the Libero SoC project configuration and are not provided as separate constraint files in this repository. Device-specific configuration files are not included due to hardware dependency and licensing restrictions. No specific host-side control software was used for this design. 

The source code allows inspection of the system architecture, timing, and data flow implemented in the reported experiments.
